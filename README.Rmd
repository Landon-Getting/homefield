## Introduction <img src="https://github.com/Landon-Getting/homefield-graphics/blob/main/sticker.png?raw=true" align="right" height="139" />

The homefield package helps gather data and create visuals to show spatial relevance of entities.

*** 

## Installation
1. Install [R and R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

2. Install the latest compatible version of [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

3. Install the devtools package.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

4. Install the homefield package via the Github repository. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Landon-Getting/homefield")
```

*homefield relies on two online databases for up-to-date college football and census information. These databases require API keys which can be requested and installed via the following instructions:*

5. Follow the directions [here](https://cfbfastr.sportsdataverse.org/#college-football-data-api-keys) to receive and install a College Football Data API Key. Required for `homefield::cfb_undefeated()` and `homefield::cfb_conquest()`.

6. Follow the directions [here](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/reference/census_api_key.html) to receive and install a CENSUS API Key. Required for `homefield::homefield_stats()`.

7. Once the package and keys have been installed, homefield can be initialized in an environment via `library()`:
```{r eval = FALSE}
library(homefield)
# your code here
```

## homefield_map()

homefield maps are created based on the attributes of **entities** including identifier, latitude, longitude, color, and image.

For instance, a map may be composed of sport teams. The Iowa State Cyclones **entity** would have an *entity identifier* (`Iowa State`), a *latitude* (`42.0266573`), a *longitude* (`-93.6464516`), a *color* (`#C8102E`), and an *image* (`http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/66.png`). 

A dataframe with multiple entities and their attributes may look similar to the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
entity <- c("Iowa State Cyclones", "Florida Gators", "UCLA Bruins")

# must be valid locations
lat <- c(42.01400, 29.64994, 34.16133)
lng <- c(-93.63577, -82.34858, -118.16765)

# must be a color in hexcode format
color <- c("#660015","#0021A5", "#ffc72c")

# can be a link or local file
image <- c("http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/66.png",
           "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/57.png",
           "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/26.png")

homefield_data <- data.frame(entity,
                             lat,
                             lng,
                             color,
                             image)

homefield_data
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
get0("homefield_data", envir = asNamespace("homefield"))
```

Next, the homefield map can be plotted with the dataframe and saved as a .png file to a specified location.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
homefield_map(x = homefield_data, # dataframe
             output_file = "C:/Users/darthvader/Downloads/example_map.png", # save location
             threshold = 10000, # area in square km
             title = "Example Map", # map title
             credit = "Landon Getting") # credit for author
```

## Getting data for homefield maps

The homefield package currently provides 2 functions to query interesting college football data directly into the structured format: `cfb_undefeated()` and `cfb_conquest()`. Remember to complete the steps in *Installation* to receive and install an College Football Database API key.


### cfb_undefeated()

`cfb_undefeated()` returns a dataframe with the undefeated teams for a particular season and week. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
cfb_undefeated_s1999_w4 <- cfb_undefeated(season = 1999, week = 4)

head(cfb_undefeated_s1999_w4)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
get0("cfb_undefeated_s1999_w4", envir = asNamespace("homefield"))
```

The dataframe output from `cfb_undefeated()` can be used directly in `homefield_map()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
homefield_map(x = cfb_undefeated(season = 1999, week = 4),
             output_file = "C:/Users/darthvader/Downloads/cfb_undefeated_s2022_w4.png",
             title = "College Football Undefeated - Season 1999 Week 4",
             credit = "Landon Getting")
```
![](https://github.com/Landon-Getting/homefield-graphics/blob/main/undefeated_map.png?raw=true)


### cfb_conquest()

In `cfb_conquest()`, teams start with the land closest to them. As the season progresses, teams acquire the land of the teams they defeat. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cfb_conquest_s1999_w4 <- cfb_conquest(season = 1999, week = 4)

head(cfb_conquest_s1999_w4)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
get0("cfb_conquest_s1999_w4", envir = asNamespace("homefield"))
```

The dataframe output from `cfb_conquest()` can be used directly in `homefield_map()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
homefield_map(x = cfb_conquest(season = 1999, week = 4),
             output_file = "C:/Users/darthvader/Downloads/cfb_conquest_s2022_w4.png",
             title = "College Football Conquest - Season 1999 Week 4",
             credit = "Landon Getting")
```

## Summarizing Maps
`homefield_stats()` generates summary statistics about a particular map including the total land, water, and population within each entity's territory.

The same dataframe input used in `homefield_map()` can be used in `homefield_stats()`. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
cfb_undefeated_s1999_w4_stats <- homefield_stats(x = cfb_undefeated(season = 1999, week = 4))

head(cfb_undefeated_s1999_w4_stats)

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
get0("cfb_undefeated_s1999_w4_stats", envir = asNamespace("homefield"))
```

### Map Stats over Time

`homefield_stats()` can also create summary statistics for maps over time using the *temporal* argument. For example, `homefield_stats()` can be combined with `cfb_undefeated()` to show statistics over the course of a season. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# undefeated for each week, 0 through 15
cfb_undefeated_2022 <- list(cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 0),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 1),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 2),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 3),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 4),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 5),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 6),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 7),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 8),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 9),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 10),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 11),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 12),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 13),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 14),
                            cfb_undefeated(season = 2022, week = 15))

# date of each week
cfb_dates_2022 <- lubridate::ymd(c("2022-08-27",
                                   "2022-09-03",
                                   "2022-09-10",
                                   "2022-09-17",
                                   "2022-09-24",
                                   "2022-10-1",
                                   "2022-10-8",
                                   "2022-10-15",
                                   "2022-10-22",
                                   "2022-10-29",
                                   "2022-11-5",
                                   "2022-11-12",
                                   "2022-11-19",
                                   "2022-11-26",
                                   "2022-12-3",
                                   "2022-12-10"))

cfb_undefeated_2022_stats <- homefield_stats(x = cfb_undefeated_2022,
                                  temporal = cfb_dates_2022,
                                  keep_max = FALSE,
                                  keep_visuals = TRUE)

```

Converting the output of square meters to square miles.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# converting land from square meters to square miles
cfb_undefeated_2022_stats <- cfb_undefeated_2022_stats |>
  dplyr::mutate(land = land/2.59e6) |>
  dplyr::select(entity,
                land,
                time,
                color,
                image)

head(cfb_undefeated_2022_stats)

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
get0("cfb_undefeated_2022_stats", envir = asNamespace("homefield"))
```

## Visualizing Stats
`homefield_racing()` generates a racing bar chart animation where entities compete for the top 10 spots based on summary statistics from `homefield_stats()`. 

For example, the output dataframe from `homefield_stats()` describing the 2022 college football season can be visualized with the `homefield_racing()` function. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
homefield_racing(x = cfb_undefeated_2022_stats,
                stat_name = "land",
                title = "2022 Season Week by Week - Undefeated CFB homefield Map",
                subtitle = "Area in Square Miles",
                caption = "Data Source: cfbd.com",
                output_file = "C:/Users/darthvader/Downloads/cfb_undefeated_2022_racing.gif")
```
